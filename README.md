## What is QSIP ?

QSIP is a SIP stack library or session handler for writing the Session Initiation Protocol. It is built over the PJSIP stack.

## Why QSIP ?

Nowadays, Qt C++ is a very popular C++ framework. It has features like signals and slots, which are not available in classic C++. Additionally, there is no SIP library in Qt. I have addressed all the issues developers encounter during integrating and developing with the PJSIP stack and provide simple interface for developers.
